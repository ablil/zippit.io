## Description

You can zip files, guess what, you can zip links too !

This is a simple URL shortener service built using AWS serverless model and NextJS.

## Why build this ?

Because I got bored on a weekend.

## Features

It's dead simple, paste a long url, zippit, and you get a short link you can use :wink:
